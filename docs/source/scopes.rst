Supported scopes
================

The following devices subclass the ScopeDevice generic interface.

.. autoclass:: scopedevice.RTMScope

    The `RecordLength` attribute is different from the ScopeDevice interface:

    .. autotangoitem:: scopedevice.RTMScope.RecordLength
        
        (Read-only for the RTM scope)

.. autoclass:: scopedevice.RTOScope

    This device turn the display of the scope off before running an acquisition.
